# Blender Window Switcher
A simple [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) application to significantly improve the [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) experience on multiple monitors. Windows only.

### AutoHotkey is not required to run the executable!

## What does it do?
While it's running, this program automatically focuses the Blender window your mouse is hovering over. This way you don't have to click it once for it to accept keyboard input (such as shortcuts).
Focus will not be switched if it's on Blender's File Viewer or Preferences or any other application.
